# MCA CRM - Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Lead Updates Not Saving to Database
**Problem:** When editing leads and updating information, changes weren't persisting to the database.

**Root Cause:** The updateLead function was trying to update fields that don't exist in the database schema or sending malformed data.

**Solutions Applied:**
- Fixed `updateLead()` function in `lib/supabase-service.ts` to properly clean data before sending to database
- Removed `id` field from update data (primary keys shouldn't be updated)
- Added proper data cleaning with null conversion for empty strings
- Added automatic `updated_at` timestamp
- Improved error logging for better debugging

### 2. ✅ Follow-up Date/Time Updates Not Persisting
**Problem:** When editing a lead's follow-up date and time, the changes wouldn't save.

**Root Cause:** Same as issue #1 - data structure problems in updateLead function.

**Solutions Applied:**
- Fixed in the updateLead function improvements above
- Added proper datetime formatting validation
- Ensured all lead fields are explicitly included when updating

### 3. ✅ Schedule Follow-up Failing with "Error Failed to Update Lead"
**Problem:** When trying to schedule a follow-up, getting error messages.

**Root Cause:** Data structure mismatch and missing required fields.

**Solutions Applied:**
- Fixed `schedule-followup-content.tsx` to create a complete lead object with all required fields
- Added date validation to prevent scheduling in the past
- Improved error handling with specific error messages
- Used clean data structure matching database schema

### 4. ✅ Button Centering Issues on Dashboard
**Problem:** Stage buttons and action buttons not properly centered in table columns.

**Root Cause:** Missing CSS classes for proper alignment.

**Solutions Applied:**
- Added `flex justify-center` wrapper divs around stage badges
- Added `flex justify-center` wrapper divs around action buttons
- Changed table headers to `text-center` for Stage and Actions columns
- Added `text-center` class to badges

### 5. ✅ Stage Updates Not Working
**Problem:** When updating the stage of a lead, changes weren't saving.

**Root Cause:** Same as issues #1-3 - updateLead function problems.

**Solutions Applied:**
- Fixed in the updateLead function improvements above
- Ensured stage field is properly included in updates
